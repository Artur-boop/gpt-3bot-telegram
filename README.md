When ChatGPT-3 was initially launched, it had limited availability, with certain countries, including [Ukraine](https://mezha.media/en/2023/01/13/chatgpt-banned-ukraine/), being excluded. 
Elon Musk did not offer any explanation for his decision to restrict Ukraine from using ChatGPT. In response, I opted to work with the hand I was dealt and decided to create a substitute solution, allowing people to explore this cutting-edge technology firsthand. 
I personally tuned the bot, leveraging the ChatGPT text-davinci-003 API for response processing. The bot was written in Python.

# Ideas
Add a language detector so that ChatGPT can function with T9, providing the bot with improved and more accurate results. This enhancement can assist in essay writing and yield superior outcomes for non-English users, eliminating mistakes.
